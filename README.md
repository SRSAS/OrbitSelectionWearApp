## Project Structure
- **MainActivity**
- **network.SocketRepository**: Deals with the network part of sending the user input through a UDP socket

App uses compose to manage UI. Main Activity uses a _style_ that desables back gesture that would interfere with user swipe.

## App Structure
- First page: Select IPV4 to send information to, click on **Connect** to move onto second page;
- Second page: Black page, send input information of coordinates from drag gestures through **SocketRepository**.
